## What is a `.wif` File?

`.wif` (Weaving Information File) is a standardized file format used to store weaving draft information, including threading, treadling, tie-up, and drawdown. Weaving-Tracker supports reading and writing `.wif` files to ensure compatibility with other weaving programs and tools.

## Getting Started

Open the html-file in your browser.<br>
Use the sliders to adjust the number of treadles and threads.<br>
Start at the bottom if you want to do treadles manually.<br>
Import and export WIF files for convenience.<br>
Press Start to begin weaving (Press Stop to edit the pattern)<br>
Click the pattern to advance the green selector row by row (so you know where you are).
